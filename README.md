# React refresher course

it's a quick course to refresh my knowledge about Reactjs.

## During the course:

1. A simple react app was created. It is focused on the functionality and not on the app style.
2. I used react hooks: useEffect, useState, useMemo, useContext, useRef.
3. I created custom hooks.
4. React transition group was used for list items animation.
5. Axios was implemented to interact with the server.
6. I installed React Router for navigation. 
7. I made pagination and infinite scrolling.
